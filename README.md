## Manual Database Migration
__Initial Schema Setup__
Using a general database diagram of an ecommerce solution as a starting point I started by creating the database named eCommerceDB.
Afterwards I created a Table and named it tProducts. </br>
This is just to make sure it's clear that it's a table by clarifying it first in the table name. </br>
The initial DB schema is contained in the file ***InitialDBsetup.sql*** </br>
__Add Product Categories__
First I create the new table and naming it tProductCategories.

__Add Product Rating__


**NOTE: I realized I made an error in the setup of the primary IDs so I went back and set to automaticly increase when new products or categories here added.** </br>
__Implement Product Ratings__
