## Manual Database Migration
__1.Initial Schema Setup__
1- Using a general database diagram of an ecommerce solution as a starting point I started by creating the database named eCommerceDB.</br>
2- Afterwards I created a script Table and with the name tProducts. </br>
3- In the script I set to table to start with 3 variables. </br>
productID INT. productName varchar(50). productPrice decumal(10,2) 
**NOTE: All table is starting with a t. This is to make sure it's clear that it's a table by clarifying it first in the table name. Also to ease futere work on the database.** </br>
The initial DB schema is contained in the file ***InitialDBsetup.sql*** </br>
__2.Add Product Categories__
1-I create the new table and named it tProductCategories.
2-Gave the table 3 variables categoryID INT. categoryName varchar(50). categoryDesc(100)
3----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4-In the script *** add-categories.sql*** 

**NOTE: I realized I made an error in the setup of the primary IDs so I went back and set to automaticly increase when new products or categories here added.It's possibly reflected in GIT** </br>
***insert_Test.sql*** </br>
__3.Implement Product Ratings__</br>
1- Like with product categories I create a new table gave it two variables ratingID(int) and ratingVal(decimal(10,2)) using the script ***add-ratings.sql***</br>
__4.Merge and Conflict Resolution__</br>
For the merge i started by setting up a new query for adding the two new friegn keys </br>
These are fk_categoryID(INT) and fk_ratingID
__5. Rollback plan__</br>
To handle roolback I chosen to use transactions and savepoints when I merge the different schemas and add the new foreign keys.
